#Distros & The Lab Environment

##What's a Distro? It's basically the Linux Kernel + a bunch of tools and apps. Each distro (like Ubuntu or Debian) is just a different "flavor" depending on what you need it for.
##Parrot OS: This is what we use in HTB. It’s based on Debian and comes pre-loaded with security and hacking tools.
##APT (Package Manager): This is the "App Store" of our system. We use it to install tools and keep the system updated with security patches.
##Why we use Linux for Research: Since it's Open Source, we can actually see the code. If something feels broken or insecure, we can dig into the source code and find out why.
