**DISTROS & THE LAB ENVIRONMENT**

WHAT'S A DISTRO?
Distro is an operating system that includes the Linux kernel, in addition, a distro typically includes many components in addition to the Linux kernel.
APT (Package Manager):
This is the "App Store" of our system. We use it to install tools and keep the system updated with security patches.
WHY WE USE LINUX FOR RESEARCH:
Since it's Open Source, we can actually see the code. If something feels broken or insecure, we can dig into the source code and find out why.


**SHELL**

WHAT'S A SHELL?
Shell is command line that provides a text-based interface between users and the kernel  for a computer system.
shell give us the abbilty to enter commands to perform actions like navigating to other directories,
working with files, and obtaining information from the system.


**TERMINAL**

WHAT'S A TERMINAL?
Terminal serves as an interface to the shell interpreter.

THE TERMINAL AND SHELL RELATIONSHIP

The Terminal acts like a "receptionist's desk",
serving as the visual gateway or interface that sends your instructions to the core system.

The Shell is the "main server room" that processes these instructions,
interpreting and executing the commands to manage data and operations.


**PROMPT DESCRIPTION**

The prompt is a line of text that tells you the system is ready for your commands.
It usually follows this format:  <username>@<hostname>:<current directory>$.
The Tilde (~): Represents your Home Directory. This is where you start when you log in.
$ (Dollar sign): You are a regular user with limited permissions.
# (Hash sign): You are the Root user (Administrator). You have full control over the system.

THE PS1 VARIABLE & TRACKING YOUR WORK

PS1 VARIABLE:
This environment variable acts as a template for your prompt.
You can customize it to show info like your IP address, the date, time, or the success/failure of your last command.
Customizing the prompt helps you keep track of your actions during a test.

BASH_HISTORY:
A file in your home directory that records all the commands you've typed.

PS1 CUSTOMIZATION - SPECIAL CHARACTERS:

Special Character                      Description

\d                                      Date (Mon Dec 29)
\D{%Y-%m-%d}                            Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
\H                                      Full hostname
\n                                      Newline
\t                                      Current time 24-hour (HH:MM:SS)
\u                                      Current username
\w                                      Full path of the current working directory


**GETTING HELP IN LINUX**

In cybersecurity, you will constantly encounter tools with parameters you don't know or tools you've never seen before.
It is vital to know how to help yourself using these built-in functions:


MAN PAGES:
Short for "manual pages." These provide detailed manuals and in-depth explanations for almost every command in Linux.

HELP FUNCTIONS:
Most tools have a built-in help flag (usually --help or -h) that gives you a quick overview of how to use the tool and its optional parameters.
Syntax:  <tool> --help

ls COMMAND:
List  information  about  the FILEs (the current directory by default).

aprops COMMAND:
Print a short description of a given keyword.
Syntax:  apropos <keyword>


**SYSTEM INFORMATION**

 The following list is essential tools to help gather information:

Command                                  Description
whoami                                   Displays current username.
id                                       Returns users identity.
hostname                                 Sets or prints the name of current host system.
uname                                    Prints basic information about the operating system name and system hardware.
pwd                                      Returns working directory name.
ip                                       A powerful utility to show or manipulate network devices, interfaces, and routing.
netstat                                  Shows network status.
ps                                       Shows process status.
who                                      Displays who is logged in.
env                                      Prints environment or sets and executes command.


LOGGING IN VIA SSH:

Definition:
A secure protocol used to access and execute commands on remote computers over a network.


OBTAINING KERNEL INFORMATION: THE UNAME COMMAND

What it does:
The uname command provides information about the system's hardware and software. Specifically, uname -r prints the Kernel Release version.

Why it's a "Golden Tool" for Researchers:
Knowing the exact kernel version allows you to quickly search for known Kernel Exploits.
you can search for vulnerabilities specific to that version to gain higher privileges.
